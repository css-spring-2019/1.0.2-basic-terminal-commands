# Basic Terminal Commands

## Notes
- In many examples, you will see a `$` to signify that you should type the rest of the line into the terminal. You do not type the `$`.
- `# text here` -> comment (instructions, donâ€™t type)
- `.` -> the current directory
- `..` -> the parent directory
- `~` -> home directory
- `<content>` -> Fill this in!!
- `[content]` -> This is optional

## Commands
*Note: for the following commands, you do not type the brackets, they indicate a placeholder. You do not type the $ either, that is to indicate you are on the command line.*
